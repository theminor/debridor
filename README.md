# debridor

debridor is a simple interface to the [Real Debrid] (https://real-debrid.com/) API using Node.js. Documentation to the Real Debrid API can be found [here](https://api.real-debrid.com/).

This is just a simple little utility to make downloading links easier. It basically works, although there is more that could be added to it. You'll want to change the appropriate settings in `settings.json`, and you might want to update the `pageTemplate.html` file to your liking. At the least, you'll probably want to update the storage locations where files are saved on the server, which are set in the `<option value="location">`s under the `<select>` in that file.
